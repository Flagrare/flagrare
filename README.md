Howdy, I’m Flagrare 🔥

Nothing connects us more than stories. Here’s mine:

- 🖥️ Fullstack Engineer: React, Svelte, Kotlin. I craft scalable, data-driven systems.

- ☁️ AWS experience: from S3 to RDS, integrating real-time and secure infrastructure.

- 🎮 Game Developer (in progress): building player-first experiences that blend code and narrative.

- 📚 Writer & Narrative Designer: passionate about designing meaning through mechanics, worldbuilding, and character.

- ✍️ Always learning, always making—whether through code, stories, or game systems.
